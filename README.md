After thoroughly reading through the complete figma, I separated it into components such as the navigation bar, side, Map, and information. The primary difficulty was implementing a map and graph in React. I searched Google for it and discovered React's ant design Library for Maps and Ant design's chart Library for Graph. It was challenging to pin a bubble chart, I'm using the Ant Design bubblechart and barchart library, but it wasn't precisely how it was in figma, so I made my own version.
